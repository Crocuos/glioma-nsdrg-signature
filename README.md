# glioma-nsdrg-signature
Minimal, reproducible code for the 11-gene NSDRG signature used in our glioma study.
This repository contains the key scripts and a small workflow to regenerate the main model-level results from public data (CGGA, TCGA, GSE131928). Large intermediate objects and some auxiliary utilities are not distributed (size/license), but the steps here allow end-to-end reproduction of the core analyses.
